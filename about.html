                            Although walk-ins are welcome upon availability, we strongly recommend scheduling an
                            appointment, as clients that have standing appointments will be seen prior to those that do
                            not.
                            Schedule appointments have a 10 minutes grace period to allow for traffic delay or parking
                            difficulties, if you arrive more than 10 minutes late we reserve the right to refuse partial
                            or complete services.

                            Appointments can be canceled 72 hours in advance by calling to the salon. We understand that
                            sometimes emergencies happen and it's not possible to give adequate notice when you can make
                            an appointment. However, if you repeatedly cancel appointments without proper notice, we
                            reserve the right to ask for a non refundable deposit to secure your next appointment or you
                            can always walk in.
